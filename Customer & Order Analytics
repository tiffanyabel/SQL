-- Goal: to query a database with multiple tables to answer questions and quantify statistics about customer and order data

--see what information is in the customers table
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers LIMIT 20;

--see what information is in each monthly sales table
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20;

--only select customers that actually have order ids
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id != 'Order ID';

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID != 'Order ID';
--Answer: 9681

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID != 'Order ID'
AND Product LIKE '%iPhone%';
--Answer: 379

--3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT c.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID != 'Order ID';
--Returns a list of 11,986 account numbers

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price = 
    (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);
--Answer: AAA Batteries (4-pack) at 2.99

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price, 2) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
HAVING total_revenue >0;
--Returns a list of 19 products and the total revenue earned for each product

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS total_quantity, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price, 2) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;
--Answer: 2 packs of AA Batteries (4-pack) for a total of 7.68

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum), ROUND(AVG(f.quantity*f.price), 2)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS f
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE f.quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID != 'Order ID';
